# AI usage
Explain how you use the AI to solve the assignment. Put all ***your used queries*** in this section & what kind of AI are you using. Declare not using AI if you didn't do this. 

To complete this task, I use AI,  in several ways like, I asked AI to create code in Qt Creator to make an interactive canvas where I could draw points, so that I could obtain the initial framework of the program and focus on developing the algorithm logic without being burdened by the details of the graphical interface. In addition, I also used AI to understand the algorithm in depth, for example by asking “explain the iteration algorithm” in order to learn how the iteration calculation works in the Convex Hull algorithm. With step-by-step explanations from the AI, I was able to understand the logic flow of each iteration, how the points were processed, and how the final result was formed. Thus, the role of AI in this task was not only as a tool to help write code, but also as an interactive learning medium that made the process more efficient while improving my conceptual understanding of the algorithms used.


# Collaboration usage
Explain how you are ***using others*** to complete the assignment in this section. Are they simply copying, learn the ideas, learn how to adapt the AI or anything involving the process. State the people if any & Please be elaborate. Declare self tought if you solved this by yourself. 

In completing this task, I received assistance from several friends who each contributed in different ways. The first person to support me was my friend Darren, who acted as the person in charge (PJ) and helped me coordinate the overall process. Following that, a few other friends, such as Darrel and Ryan, assisted me with the technical setup, such as installing the necessary software and configuring the development environment. My friends also guided me in considering how to adapt and organize the solution, ensuring that I didn’t simply replicate it but actually learned how to implement the concepts in my own project. 

# Commit Rules
Use .gitignore to stripe any binaries from the resulting build before commit.  If you cloned directly from the template, you are safe.
